no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

advancing to distance:    2
                          1
                          0

ff: found legal plan as follows

step    0: FERRESERVA R2 A1
        1: FERRESERVA R1 A1
